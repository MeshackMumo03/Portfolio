# Portfolio
This is an update of the first portfolio https://meshackmumo03.github.io/Meshack_Mumo.github.io/
This is a better version and should be able to have more interactive UI&UX and more projects and designs being on show.
Additionally, an update in the Contact Me part where users can be able to reach out to me in my email using noreply API. 
In addition to the programming languages that I used in the first one (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and BOOTSRAP), I'll add more like ReactJs and add more API that will be available for this portfolio.

All are welcome for any recommendable changes.
